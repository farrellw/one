# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

This app is a function of API references and javascript.  It uses a rails 5 framework, server-side ruby 2.3.1 and client side javascript.  Using the app you can get information from spotify, instagram, and weather.

The app is meant as a practice for javascript and API querying, but also practices skills such as protecting auth keys when necessary through environment variables.
The project can be accessed on heroku at https://one-one.herokuapp.com/
